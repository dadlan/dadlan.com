# DadLAN awoken

In the beginning of LAN parties, kids would hug their 17 inch CRTs across cities to host local game servers and stink up their parents basements. These kids now run and maintain domains, deny pull requests and change diapers.

These fellow dads get together to get back to their roots. Loud celebrations of good food, drinks, and smoke are had!
